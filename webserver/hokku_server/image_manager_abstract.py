"""AbstractImageManager: image lifecycle + on-disk cache (dispatch-agnostic).

Outside callers see real filenames ("photo.jpg"). On-disk cache files are
keyed by sha1(name) so odd characters / unicode / length aren't a concern.
The single source of truth for what's known to ImageManager is
``<cache_dir>/image_manager.json``.

Concrete subclasses (SingleThreadedImageManager, MultiThreadedImageManager)
implement ``_dispatch_render`` and ``resolved_worker_count`` — everything
else is shared logic and lives here.
