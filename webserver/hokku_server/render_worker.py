"""Top-level worker function submitted to the ProcessPoolExecutor.

Must be a module-level (picklable) callable.  All imports are done inside
the function body so they happen in the worker process, not in the parent
at import time — this avoids pickling large objects across the IPC boundary.

Public interface
----------------
render_one(image_path, image_config_dict, orientation, crop_to_fill_threshold,
           face_bbox)
    → (panel_bytes: bytes, preview_bytes: bytes)

Why dicts, not dataclasses?
    The dataclasses are picklable *today*, but any future refactor that adds a
    non-picklable field (callable, lock) would silently break workers.
    Round-tripping through ``_image_config_from_dict`` keeps the IPC contract
    narrow and easy to audit.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image_path:
        Absolute path to the source image file.
    image_config_dict:
        ``dataclasses.asdict(image_config)`` — the full ImageConfig as a plain
        dict, ready to be reconstructed via ``_image_config_from_dict``.
    orientation:
        ``"landscape"`` or ``"portrait"``.
    crop_to_fill_threshold:
        Passed through to ``render_panel_bytes``; controls when the image is
        cropped to fill the panel (0.0 = never crop, always letterbox).
    clahe_keepout_bboxes:
        BoundingBox instances as dicts (asdict result) of detected faces,
        or None.  Passed to the renderer to scope CLAHE away from the faces.

    Returns
    -------
    (panel_bytes, preview_bytes)
        ``panel_bytes``   — full-resolution packed panel buffer (TOTAL_BYTES long).
        ``preview_bytes`` — PNG bytes of the preview image.
