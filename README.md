Everything you'd want from a photo frame: accurate colours, full privacy, a clean web app, and the ability to run as many frames as you like from one cheap server. Open source replacement firmware and image server for the Hokku / Huessen 13.3" six-colour e-ink frame.

## Core features

**Photos, your way**
- **Local-only** — your photos never leave your network. No cloud, no third-party servers, no telemetry. The web app itself makes no external requests — fonts and assets are self-hosted, so nothing is phoned home just by opening a browser tab. Your hardware and open source software means you're in full control.
- **Drag-and-drop upload** — single files or dozens at a time, straight into the web app, with a live progress list. Works on phones too.
- **Browse in a grid** — preview exactly what the frame will show before it shows it, original and converted version side by side. Delete anything you don't want with one click.
- **Click any photo** — see how it was processed and compare the original against what's going to the frame at full size.
- **All the formats you actually have** — JPEG, PNG, HEIC/HEIF, AVIF, WebP, GIF, TIFF, BMP, JPEG XL. Anything from 90s scanned prints to modern iPhone, Android, and JPEG XL. Phone photos auto-rotate.
- **Landscape or portrait** — flip a switch and everything re-converts to match how the frame is mounted.
- **Jump the queue** — pick any photo in the library to be the next one shown on the frame.

**Looks good on e-paper**
- **Correct out of the box** — pre-set for the best results on this panel without any tweaking.
- **Adapts to each photo** — it can tell a black-and-white photo from a colour one, and recognise faces (all done locally, nothing leaves your network), and picks the best conversion approach for each automatically.
- **No ugly borders** — photos that are close to the right shape get a subtle crop to fill the screen cleanly instead of showing a letterbox band.
- **Tunable to the nth degree** — three independent conversion profiles (general, black-and-white, faces) with curated presets, plus an advanced panel that exposes nine palette colour-space variants (CIELAB / weighted CIELAB / OKLAB / CAM16-UCS, each with optional hue gating, plus a B&W-only LUT) and chroma-boost / dynamic-range knobs you can run in CIELAB or OKLAB independently. ([Details on dithering](docs/dithering.md))
- **Colour-accurate** — calibrated against the actual panel, not a theoretical colour profile.

**Smart about frames**
- **Multiple frames, one server** — each frame gets a name and shows up in a dashboard with battery level, WiFi signal, and when it'll next update. Each frame carries its own orientation, so you can mix landscape and portrait frames against the same library.
- **Fair rotation** — every photo gets its turn. Newly uploaded photos go to the front of the queue; after that, whichever image has been shown least goes next.
- **Battery lasts months** — the frame uses almost no power between refreshes. The web app shows a battery level for each frame and flags it red when it's getting low.
- **Problems show up on the screen** — if something goes wrong (wrong WiFi password, server unreachable) the frame displays a plain-English explanation on the e-paper itself instead of going blank. No plugging in a laptop to debug.
- **Late-frame warning** — if a frame misses its scheduled update by more than an hour, the web app flags it so you know to check WiFi or the battery.
- **Scheduled updates** — set the times you want the photo to change (e.g. morning, noon, evening) and the frame wakes up on its own. No constant connection needed.
- **Settings are on the server** — change the schedule or any other server setting in the web app and every frame picks it up automatically. No restarts, no reflashing.
- **Instant refresh** — there's a button on the frame that forces an immediate update whenever you want one.
- **Diagnostics on demand** — one click in the web app shows the frame's status without needing a cable.
- **What happened last refresh** — after every update the frame sends a log of what it did to the server (WiFi connection, image download, display result). Open a frame's details in the web app to read it — no cable, no terminal needed.
- **Comically over-engineered firmware** — runs at 240 MHz (up from the 160 MHz default) on a dual-core processor with the compiler's maximum optimisations turned on, code and data copied into dedicated high-speed RAM at boot, and cache tuned for the exact chip revision on your board. Completely unnecessary for a frame that wakes up once a day, downloads a picture, and goes back to sleep. We did it anyway. 🚀

**Easy to run**
- **Everything through the web app** — upload, browse, configure. No command line, no shared drives to set up.
- **Fast even on small hardware** — converting a big library of photos uses all available CPU cores and finishes much sooner than doing them one at a time. A Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W handles a multi-frame setup without breaking a sweat.
- **Bad photos are handled gracefully** — if a photo can't be converted, it's set aside with an explanation rather than silently vanishing. You can retry or remove it with one click.
- **Progress while you wait** — a status bar shows how many photos are being converted and roughly how long it'll take.
- **Find it on your network by name** — the server advertises itself as `hokku.local` via mDNS, so you can bookmark `http://hokku.local:8080/` and never chase a changing IP address again.
- **Runs on basically anything, installs in minutes** — a Debian package for Linux that starts automatically, or run from source on macOS, Windows, or a Raspberry Pi. The firmware comes pre-built and the setup wizard flashes it over USB. No build tools, no command line.
- **One-click re-convert** — want to try a different look? One button re-processes everything from scratch.

## The web app

<img src="images/ui_v2_gallery.png" width="600">

Your control centre for everything: upload and browse photos, preview exactly how each one will look on the six-colour screen, manage your frames, and change any setting — all live, with no page reloads. It works just as well on a phone as on a computer.

The server ships with two interfaces, and both talk to the same backend:

- **Modern app** — a redesigned, mobile-first interface at **`/hokku/app`** (the recommended default).
- **Classic page** — the original three-tab interface (Images, Screens, Config) at **`/hokku/ui`**, unchanged.

The plain address `http://<your-server>:8080/` opens whichever you set as the default (`"default_ui"` in `config.json`). 

For a full, illustrated walkthrough of every feature on both phone and computer, see the **[web app guide in the manual »](docs/manual.md#1-the-web-app)**.

## System Requirements

**Server side** — any Linux, macOS, Windows, or Raspberry Pi on the same local network as the frame. A Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W is the recommended choice: cheap, silent, always-on, and more than fast enough. Around 512 MB of RAM; a few GB of disk for photos.

**Frame side** — a Hokku Designs / Huessen 13.3" six-colour e-ink frame (ESP32-S3 inside), a data-capable USB-C cable for first-time setup, and a 2.4 GHz WiFi network.

See **[Hardware](docs/hardware.md)** for where to buy the frame and the recommended Pi kit.

## Installation

<img src="images/frame_x_pi.png" width="500">

Hokku loves Pi! If you need to pick one up, the **[hardware guide](docs/hardware.md)** has a tested parts list that arrives next-day in the US. Connect both to your computer, run `hokku_setup.bat`, and the guided installer takes care of the rest.

Prefer terminal tabs, mysterious pip errors, and the satisfaction of doing things the hard way? We've got you covered: **[Manual installation guide](docs/install.md)**.

## Buttons and LEDs

**The button** on the back of the frame (right-hand side in landscape, lower side in portrait) forces an immediate refresh — pulls the next image from the server right now, ignoring the schedule. Works whether the frame is deep-asleep on battery, plugged into USB, or anywhere in between.

**Two tiny LEDs** on the bottom of the frame:

- **Red** — blinks when a computer is connected over USB. A plain wall charger won't trigger it, though the battery still charges fine either way.
- **Green** — on while the frame is fetching a new photo over WiFi. Off the rest of the time.

## Background

I bought this frame in October 2025 from [Wayfair](https://www.wayfair.com/decor-pillows/pdp/hokku-designs-133-inch-wifi-epaper-art-photo-frame-w115006181.html) for about $280 — the cheapest Spectra 6 e-ink display I could find. The stock firmware didn't reliably update the image and was generally a pain to work with, so it was time to replace it. There's no public documentation on the hardware, so I had to do everything the hard way. Decided to make it an experiment in vibe coding something complex; the repo contains zero lines of human-written code.

Claude Opus 4.6-4.7 was used throughout. Unfortunately, one cannot simply tell AI to build this firmware and hope it works — it takes a lot of pushing, prodding and domain knowledge for it to finally do what I needed it to do. AI proved excellent at analysing the original firmware, but needed a lot of hand-holding when writing the hardware interface. My conclusion is that AI, at the time of building this, is a savant fruitfly with ADHD: absolutely blow-me-away amazing at some things, has no idea what it did a minute ago, plain stupid at times, and way too eager to just _do_ things if you don't hold it in check. Can't recommend a vibe-coding career in embedded software just quite yet :)
