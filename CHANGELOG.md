# Changelog

## Unreleased

### New web app

A redesigned, mobile-first web app is now available alongside the original page, served at `/hokku/app`. It works just as well on a phone as on a computer and talks to the same server, so nothing about your frames or photos changes when you switch. You get a photo gallery, a detail view that previews how each photo will look on the six-colour screen, connected-frame management, and every setting in one place.

The plain address `/` opens whichever interface you set as the default — set `"default_ui": "modern"` in `config.json` for the new app, or `"classic"` (the default) for the original page, which stays at `/hokku/ui` and is unchanged. See the [user manual](docs/manual.md#1-the-web-app) for a full walkthrough with screenshots.

### Send a photo to a specific frame

You can now send a chosen photo to one particular frame for its next refresh, rather than only queuing it into the shared rotation. Open a photo's actions in the web app and pick the frame under "Send to a frame". The override is per-screen, survives a server restart, and is consumed the next time that frame checks in.

## 3.1.0 alpha 1

### Frame log upload

After every refresh the frame now sends a log of everything that happened — WiFi connection, image download, display result — to the server as part of the refresh request. The server stores the last log received per frame and shows it in the screen detail modal. No cable or serial terminal needed to see what the frame has been doing.

The log buffer lives in the frame's RTC memory, so it survives deep sleep and accumulates across multiple cycles. Each upload covers the last several refresh cycles' worth of diagnostics.

### Colour space improvements

Two new dithering colour spaces: **OKLAB** and **CAM16-UCS**, joining the existing CIELAB variants. Each can be used independently for palette matching, adaptive saturation, and dynamic range compression. For most photos the results are similar to CIELAB; CAM16-UCS tends to hold hue accuracy better on saturated colours.

### Orientation filter per screen

Each screen now carries its own orientation (landscape or portrait) and the server serves only images converted for that orientation. Previously orientation was a global server setting. Multiple screens with different orientations can run from the same image library simultaneously.

### Relative next-update time in Screens tab

The "next update" time in the Screens tab now shows both the absolute time and a relative "in X minutes / X hours" label.

### Web app housekeeping

The separate "Clear cache" and "Re-convert all" buttons are merged into one. The image detail modal now shows the minimum letterbox fill threshold.

### Firmware 1.2.4

- **Frame log upload** — ring buffer in RTC memory captures log output across deep sleep cycles and POSTs it to the server on each refresh.
- **Firmware version in log** — every boot logs the firmware version and build timestamp as the first line, visible both on serial and in every log dump shown in the web app.
- **Performance** — CPU bumped to 240 MHz; compiler optimised at -O3; code and rodata execute from PSRAM (eliminating flash/PSRAM cache contention during image downloads); instruction cache doubled to 32 KB; chip revision v0.2 targeting drops a now-unnecessary silicon workaround.
- **Build tooling** — `build.bat` sets all required environment variables; `IDF_TARGET` explicitly declared in `CMakeLists.txt`; `cppcheck` linting added to CI.

---

## 3.0.1 (dev)

### Global orientation removed

The server-wide Orientation setting is gone. Each screen now owns its
own orientation; a brand-new screen defaults to landscape. The global
`orientation` field in `config.json` is dropped (schema bumped to v6 —
existing configs auto-migrate).

Dither previews — both the cached preview shown in the image grid /
detail modal and the on-the-fly preview in the Advanced dither panel —
are now rendered in the image's native orientation. A landscape photo
previews landscape, a portrait photo previews portrait, regardless of
any screen's setting.

## 3.0 beta6

### Upgrade fix

Upgrading the `.deb` package on a running server no longer fails with a
"port in use" error. The postinst script now stops the service before
installing new dependencies.

### Version shown in web app footer

The web app footer now displays the running server version (e.g. `3.0.0b6`),
making it easy to confirm which build is active without checking the command
line.

### AVIF and JPEG XL file extension fix

`.avif` and `.jxl` were missing from the internal list of recognised image
extensions. Files with these types now work correctly throughout the server,
not just at the upload endpoint.

---

## 3.0 beta5

### Per-screen orientation override

Each frame can now be locked to landscape or portrait independently of the global server setting. A frame mounted in portrait shows portrait-rendered images; another mounted in landscape shows landscape ones — both from the same library, without reconfiguring the server. Set and clear the override from the Screens tab in the web app. The server pre-renders both orientations for every image so serving the right one is instant.

### JPEG XL support

JPEG XL (`.jxl`) is now accepted at upload and converted like any other format. Requires `pillow-jxl-plugin`, which the `.deb` postinst installs automatically.

### Multi-face CLAHE protection

Face detection now returns all detected faces, not just the largest one. All detected bounding boxes are passed to the CLAHE preparation step as keepout regions. The boundary between each protected face region and the surrounding image is blended with a Gaussian feather (sigma proportional to the canvas size) so there is no hard edge at the face boundary. The feather width is controlled by `clahe_keepout_feather` in `ImageConfig` (default `0.015`, meaning 1.5% of the shorter canvas dimension).

### Face bounding box overlay in dither preview

The dither preview in the web UI now draws the face bounding boxes (as detected by YuNet) over the rendered preview image. The overlay updates live as you change the dither settings, making it easy to see whether a face region is being handled correctly.

### B&W palette LUT

A new LUT variant (`lut_name = "bw"`) restricts quantisation to Black and White only. This eliminates any possibility of a colour ink landing on a near-greyscale image — previously, compression noise in JPEG-encoded B&W photos could occasionally cause a pink or red speckle even when routed through the B&W pipeline. The B&W preset now uses this LUT by default.

### Panel cache compression

Rendered panel binaries (`.bin`) are now stored compressed with zstd level 1. Each 480 KB panel shrinks to roughly half that on disk with negligible CPU overhead. The decompression cost (microseconds) is absorbed in the HTTP response path. Old uncompressed `.bin` files in the cache are detected and re-queued for re-render automatically.

### Graceful HTTP 503 handling

When the server returns 503 (image pool empty, or all images still converting), the firmware now silently waits and retries at the server-specified interval rather than rendering a "no images" message on screen. The screen stays on its current image until new content is ready.

---

## 3.0 beta3–beta4

### B&W dithering: two-tone palette + classifier cache

- Added B&W detection pipeline and `image_config_bw` config slot.
- B&W detector samples a 200×200 thumbnail and checks 95th-percentile Lab chroma against `GRAYSCALE_CHROMA_THRESHOLD = 8.0`.
- Classifier results cached in `<cache_dir>/image_classifier.json` keyed by file sha1 — no re-detection on restart.
- Clearing the classifier cache now triggers an immediate sync instead of waiting for the next poll interval.

### JXL end-to-end fix

Registration of the JXL PIL plugin moved to the Flask app factory so JXL decodes correctly in all code paths (upload, sync, preview).

### Progress tracking fix

`_progress` is now reset at the start of `sync()` when the previous batch has finished. Previously, a server restart mid-batch left the progress counter stuck at a stale done/total pair until a new batch started.

### Upload error reporting

Full tracebacks for upload and image processing failures now appear in the server log.

## 3.0 beta1–beta2

---

## 3.0 alpha

### ~250× faster image conversion

The dither pipeline's inner pixel loop is now compiled to native code via **Numba JIT** (`@numba.njit(nogil=True)`). On a Raspberry Pi the full 3200×1600 panel converts in roughly **1–2 seconds** instead of 4–8 minutes. The GIL is released during the compiled loop, so multiple concurrent renders in the thread pool make genuine CPU progress instead of serialising.

The new default ditherer (`NumbaStreamingDither`) uses the same stripe-by-stripe memory model as before (≤ 50 MB peak), so memory usage is unchanged.

### Architecture: strategy-pattern dither + renderer

- **`AbstractDither`** ABC with four concrete implementations:
  - `StreamingDither` — pure-Python, stripe-based (slow, baseline)
  - `UnconstrainedDither` — pure-Python, full-canvas (~60 MB peak)
  - `NumbaStreamingDither` — JIT stripe-based, production default
  - `NumbaUnconstrainedDither` — JIT full-canvas, for quality comparisons
- **`AbstractImageRenderer`** / **`ImageRenderer`** — renderer takes any `AbstractDither` as a strategy; swapping the dither changes memory/speed without touching rendering logic.

### Face-aware dithering

YuNet face detection (OpenCV DNN) is now integrated into the pre-processing pipeline. When enabled, detected faces are used to bias chroma and sharpness enhancements toward the subject. Configurable via `face_detector` in `AppConfig`.

### Parallel render pool

`image_worker_thread_count` in `AppConfig` controls the number of threads in the render pool. Default 1; increase to overlap renders when multiple images are queued. Safe with `NumbaStreamingDither` because the JIT loop releases the GIL.

---

## 2.1

Two big themes: **in-browser image management** (no more Samba or SSH) and **bulletproof deep-sleep / refresh handling** (the v2.0 firmware had several edge cases where a frame could get stuck never updating, or wake at the wrong time, or be hard to reflash). Plus the unified "60 s post-display awake window" model that replaced three separate ad-hoc waits.

### Web GUI

- **Drag-and-drop upload** anywhere on the page. Whole window becomes a drop zone while dragging; click the upload zone to file-browse. Multiple files at once with a per-file progress list. Filename collisions auto-suffixed (`_1`, `_2`, …).
- **Per-image trash button** with a styled in-page confirmation (Esc cancels, Enter confirms, click backdrop dismisses). Removes the original *and* its cached dithered binary, preview PNG, and thumbnail. Cache stays in sync via `_sync_pool` coalescing concurrent triggers.
- **Image grid shows every uploaded file immediately**, even ones still being converted. Pending entries get a yellow "Dithering…" badge and a faded thumbnail. Status bar reads `N / M ready` while a batch is in progress, plain count when fully caught up. Thumbnail pre-pass at the start of every sync so the grid populates with visible previews even during long dither batches.
- **Per-image stats**: shown count, total display time (human-formatted: `2h 14m`, `3d 5h`), last-displayed timestamp.
- **Connected-screens table**: name, IP, request count, last-seen timestamp, next-scheduled update time (computed from the screen's last `X-Sleep-Seconds` response).
- **REST endpoints** for everything the GUI does: `POST /hokku/api/upload` (multipart), `DELETE /hokku/api/image/<name>`, plus `status`, `original/<name>`, `thumbnail/<name>`, `dithered/<name>`, `show_next/<name>`, `config`, `clear_cache`. All error paths return JSON with a meaningful message — used to leak HTML 500 pages that the GUI parsed as "Unexpected token `<`".

### Server reliability

- **Sleep-accuracy logging.** New `X-Server-Time-Epoch` response header lets the firmware compare actual vs expected sleep duration on the next wake. Logged as `Sleep check: expected=Ns actual=Ms error=±Ks`.
- **`X-Sleep-Seconds` always set** — including on 503/404 responses (capped retry) so the firmware doesn't fall back to its 3 h default after a transient empty-pool window.
- **Thumbnail generator** flattens RGBA / LA / palette-with-transparency PNGs onto a white background before encoding to JPEG. Previously crashed with `cannot write mode RGBA as JPEG` and the image disappeared from the GUI.

### Firmware (the long road)

The v2.0 firmware had a single subtle bug — `esp_sleep_get_wakeup_cause()` occasionally returns `ESP_SLEEP_WAKEUP_UNDEFINED` instead of `TIMER` after a real timer wake on ESP32-S3. v2.0 treated that as "USB host reset, skip fetch", which on a device that kept misclassifying meant: fetch once, then never update again. v2.1 went through several rounds of fixing it, each round revealing the next problem:

- **RTC-clock-based deadline tracking.** Pre-sleep deadline stored in `esp_clk_rtc_time()` units. On wake from any cause: compare with current RTC clock. At/past deadline ⇒ fetch (timer fired, possibly misclassified). Clearly before deadline ⇒ skip (real USB reset, image is fresh). Backed by a 26 h sanity guard that discards a stored deadline if the gap is implausibly large (RTC counter reset while RTC memory survived).
- **`enter_deep_sleep` now honors its contract.** The 120 s reflash wait inside `enter_deep_sleep` used to be added on top of the caller's `sleep_us`; now it's subtracted from the timer arm so the deadline is what the caller asked for.
- **Unified "60 s post-display awake window".** Replaced three separate stages (30 s scheduled-wake wait, 60 s first-boot button polling, 120 s reflash wait inside `enter_deep_sleep`). Now a single `stay_awake_with_buttons()` runs after every displayed image — including error screens. Buttons polled continuously throughout. Pressing the button fetches the next image and extends the window by another full 60 s. Reflash window and button window are the same window.
- **Button polling on GPIO 1 + GPIO 12** (both RTC-wake-capable). GPIO 40 (legacy "switch photo") dropped — not wake-capable on ESP32-S3, so polling it gave half-broken UX. Either of the two RTC-capable buttons does the same job whether the chip is awake or asleep.
- **Button-pin de-isolation** in `stay_awake_with_buttons`. Without `rtc_gpio_hold_dis` + `rtc_gpio_deinit` first, `gpio_config` is silently ineffective on a pin still in RTC-peripheral mode (left there by factory firmware or our own previous `enter_deep_sleep`). Symptom was "button always pressed" → endless fetch loop until the battery died.
- **Spurious-reset safety valve.** The `is_usb_reset_after_sleep` shortcut (skip display init, immediate sleep) caps at 3 consecutive triggers; the next wake forces the full path with a 60 s reflash window. Prevents a chip stuck in a brownout / silicon-quirk reset loop from being unreflashable.
- **USB polling loop** uses `esp_clk_rtc_time()` as the exit condition (not accumulated `vTaskDelay` durations, which under-count by ~1 % per chunk and drifted ~7 min over a 12 h interval).
- **Charger LED behaviour.** `chg_monitor_stop()` moved to just before `esp_deep_sleep_start()`/`esp_restart()` so the red LED blinks throughout the entire awake window. "Device is on and charging" is visible all the way until the chip actually powers down.
- **Failure feedback over LED.** Green WIFI_LED triple-blinks rapidly if a button-triggered fetch fails — so the button isn't mistaken for broken.
- **`wifi_events` event-group leak** fixed (created once, reused). **`strncpy`** of WiFi SSID/password now always null-terminates.
- Display error messages on screen for cfg-version mismatch, missing config, download failure — with the same 60 s reflash/button window applied.

### Versions in this branch

The v2.1 development was a series of incremental releases (v2.1.0 through v2.1.10) as the firmware refresh-loop bugs were chased down one layer at a time. v2.1.10 is the rolled-up release.

---

## 2.0.1

Complete rewrite of the release and deployment model. The firmware is now shipped as a pre-built binary — no toolchain needed. Configuration is stored in NVS and flashed via a setup tool. The webserver has a web GUI and supports multiple screens.

### Privacy

**Your photos stay on your network.** The stock firmware sends your pictures to servers on the other side of the world. This project replaces it entirely. Your photos go straight from your computer to the frame, never leaving your home network. No cloud, no accounts, no data collection.

### New: Setup tool (`hokku-setup`)

- Interactive console installer — detects devices, flashes firmware, writes config
- No ESP-IDF toolchain needed — ships pre-built firmware binaries
- `hokku_setup.bat` for one-shot Windows setup
- Auto-detects ESP32-S3 via USB (VID:PID 303a:1001)
- Reads device state in a single flash read (NVS + app header)
- Identifies Hokku firmware by project name in app binary
- Shows firmware version comparison (device vs release build timestamps)
- Configure-before-flash: NVS config written first so device boots ready
- Auto-backup of existing config before every write
- NVS partition generated via ESP-IDF's `nvs_partition_gen.py` for guaranteed format compatibility

### New: Web GUI

- Accessible at `http://server:port/` (redirects to `/hokku/ui`)
- **Configuration panel**: timezone picker with live server time, refresh schedule (HHMM format), orientation (landscape/portrait), poll interval
- **Connected screens table**: tracks every screen that calls in (name, IP, request count, last seen)
- **Image grid**: thumbnails of all images with original/dithered view links, show count, total display time (human-formatted), "Show Next" button
- **Processing indicator**: shows which image is being dithered, batch progress (e.g. "2 of 5"), and a banner showing remaining count
- **Clear cache** button for full re-conversion
- Config changes saved to disk via POST API

### New: Multi-screen support

- Screens identify themselves via `X-Screen-Name` HTTP header
- Screen name stored in firmware NVS (max 64 bytes)
- Server tracks all screens in `database.json` (name, IP, request count, last seen)
- Device endpoint renamed from `/spectra6` to `/hokku/screen/`

### New: Server-driven sleep schedule

- Firmware has no concept of time, timezone, or NTP — all removed
- Server calculates seconds until next refresh from `refresh_image_at_time` config
- Sleep duration sent as `X-Sleep-Seconds` HTTP response header on image download
- One HTTP call does everything: image + sleep duration

### New: Fair image distribution

- Replaced shuffled playlist with `show_index` ranking system (supports negative values for priority)
- New images automatically get priority: existing show_index values reset to 1
- "Show Next" button in web GUI sets show_index to min-1
- Tracks `total_show_count` and `total_show_minutes` per image with human-readable formatting
- Display time tracked: when next image is served, elapsed time added to previous image
- Random tie-breaking when multiple images have the same show_index
- Persistent tracking in `database.json`

### New: NVS config system

- All configuration (WiFi SSID/password, server URL, screen name) stored in NVS
- `secrets.h` removed entirely — no compile-time configuration
- Config version byte (`cfg_ver`) for forward compatibility
- Firmware validates config version on boot, shows on-screen error if mismatched
- On-screen error messages for: missing config, version mismatch, download failure

### New: Debian packaging

- `pyproject.toml` for pip-installable webserver (`hokku-server` command)
- Full `debian/` packaging: control, rules, systemd service, postinst, conffiles
- `DynamicUser=yes` with `StateDirectory` for secure service isolation

### Firmware changes

- Build timestamp version (YYYYMMDDHHMMSSZ) embedded at fixed offset in app binary
- Removed NTP sync, timezone handling, and schedule calculation
- Removed embedded calibration image
- RTC magic value validates stale RTC memory after flash
- USB charging detection: stays awake instead of boot-looping when USB connected
- 120-second reflash window before every deep sleep
- EXIF orientation applied before image processing (fixes rotated phone photos)
- Padding areas forced to pure white after dithering (fixes dotted line artifacts)

### Webserver changes

- Configurable orientation: landscape or portrait
- Configurable poll interval (`poll_interval_seconds`)
- Config file loaded from `HOKKU_CONFIG` env, `./config.json`, or `/etc/hokku/config.json`
- Config saveable from web GUI
- `strict_slashes=False` on device endpoint (no more 308 redirects)
- EXIF orientation applied in image conversion and thumbnail generation
- All endpoints renamed from `/spectra6/` to `/hokku/`
- Removed `/hokku/preview`, `/hokku/status`, `/hokku/clear_cache` (replaced by `/hokku/api/*`)

### Breaking changes

- Firmware no longer reads `secrets.h` — use `hokku-setup` to flash NVS config
- Server endpoint changed from `GET /spectra6` to `GET /hokku/screen/`
- `database.json` format changed: `show_count` renamed to `show_index`, added `total_show_count` and `total_show_minutes`
- Old `database.json` files auto-migrated on load

## 1.0.0

Initial release. Firmware decoded from original Huessen firmware disassembly. Webserver with Floyd-Steinberg dithering to Spectra 6 palette.
